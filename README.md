# Month

A simple Python program that tells you whether it's time for vacation or school based on the month you enter!

## Overview

This project is a beginner-friendly Python script that:
- Prompts the user to enter the current month.
- Checks if the input is a valid month.
- Tells the user whether it's a vacation month (June, July, August) or a school month.

## Features

- **Input validation:** Ensures the user enters a valid month name.
- **User-friendly output:** Fun emoji messages for school or vacation time.
- **Easy to understand:** Simple code, great for those learning Python basics.
